# Hi! I'm Tim.
🧑‍💻 — I'm a software engineer. 

🎵 — I graduated from Princeton summa cum laude in 2020 with a Music degree. I had planned to go on to get my Master's and PhD in Musicology, studying musicology's potential for social change, but after spending a year of self-study grappling with the question of how my discipline could enact change in the world, I decided I could have a bigger impact in another domain.

🇩🇪 — In August 2021, I decided to switch paths completely, and enrolled at the Technical University of Berlin to study computer science.

🧠 — You see, I realized that where I could be of more use to society is in software, whose importance has grown consistently over the past decades, and will only become more important as the digital world expands its domain over our lives. Luckily, I had already taken a few CS courses at Princeton for fun, and so I wasn't starting completely from square one. Now, through a combination of formal education in Berlin, and a smattering of freelance work and personal projects, I have set out on the exhilarating, ever-deepening journey to become a software engineer.

😊 — On my GitHub you'll find a variety of projects I've undertaken to consolidate what I've learned so far. Also, check out my personal website! (timruszala.com)
